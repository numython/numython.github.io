Like Python and wxWidgets, wxPython is Open Source which means that it is free for anyone to use and the source code is available for anyone to look at and modify. Or anyone can contribute fixes or enhancements to the project.        wxPython is a cross-platform toolkit. This means that the same program will run on multiple platforms without modification. Currently supported platforms are 32-bit Microsoft Windows, most Unix or unix-like systems, and Macintosh OS X.      <br><br></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><button class="btn-primary">PyQt</button>     <br><div class="collapse" id="pyqt">PyQt is one of the two most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework (another binding is PySide).

PyGTK applications are truly multiplatform and they're able to run, unmodified, on Linux, Windows, MacOS X and other platforms.        Other distinctive features of PyGTK are, besides its ease of use and rapid prototyping, its first class accessibility support or the capability to deal with complex multilingual or bidirectional text for fully localized applications.        PyGTK is free software, so you can use, modify, distribute and study it with very few restrictions (LGPL license)      </div></div></div></div></body></html>
